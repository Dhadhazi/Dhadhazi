When I was starting web development, I focused on getting strong fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Javascript. For my projects, I like to use React TypeScript with GraphQL and trying out new frameworks such as NextJS. My greatest assets are communication, organization, and the ability to learn quickly. Looking for full time employment in/near Amsterdam!
