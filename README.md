When I was starting web development, I focused on getting strong fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Javascript. For my projects, I like to use React TypeScript with GraphQL and trying out new frameworks such as NextJS. My greatest assets are communication, organization, and the ability to learn quickly. I am currently studying for my next AWS Certificate while also deepening my knowledge about Web Accessibility and Serverless Functions.
