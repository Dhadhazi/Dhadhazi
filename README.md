## Daniel Hadhazi

When I was starting web development I focused to get strong fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Javascript. For my projects, I like to use React TypeScript with GraphQL, and trying out new frameworks such as NextJS. My greatest assets are communication, organization, and the ability to learn quickly. Currently studying for my next AWS Certificate, while also deepening my knowledge about Web Accessibility, and Serverless Functions.
